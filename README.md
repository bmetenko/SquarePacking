Simple OOP (class-based) implementation of packing Square instances into a SquareCanvas.

Main functionality of the code exemplified in the pySquares.ipynb. 

Maintenance or updates unclear since only a toy project.

Todo:
* command line interface
* rewrite in other languages
* custom shape inputs (CustomCanvas) (-1 fill blank) and all check in bounds for zero.
* color individual squares
